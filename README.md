The current file is being manipulated wit main pytorch rahter than main as an easier to modify the epoch values, training and test

There was issues with loading the data as my github key is not working on and the collab account wouldnt connect. The code currnently works as we have tested the curves but maniulating the second one might be harder since its not on main, tho still accesible in the decoder
